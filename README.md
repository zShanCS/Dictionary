# Dictionary
a dictionary that saves a word, its meaning, antonyms and synonyms plus other fancy things you find in a dictionary.

we know if we put a billion unsorted elements in a singly linked list or array,
the complexity to find one specific item would be O(n) 
which is really really bad for a large number of items i.e lets say 10 billions. 

what if I told you you could do this in O(m) where m is number of characters in your word. unbelievable right?
well belive it cause we  are gonna implement this in this repo.

we are going to use a rarely used form of trees. a highly specific form of trees called trie.
also trie is pronounced as try in case you were wondering
